# How to Contribute

## Formatting

Starlark files should be formatted by buildifier.
CI will yell at you about formatting/linting violations.

## Updating BUILD files

Some targets are generated from sources.
Currently this is just the `bzl_library` targets.
Run `bazel run //:gazelle` to keep them up-to-date.

## Releasing

1. Determine the next release version, following semver (could automate in the future from changelog)
1. Tag the repo and push it (or create a tag in GH UI)
1. Watch the automation run on GitHub actions
